1. Introduction

In today's financial landscape, predicting stock prices is critical yet challenging. Vinamilk, a prominent dairy producer in Vietnam, presents an intriguing case study due to its market significance and dynamic stock performance. This project aims to utilize LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models, a type of recurrent neural network known for its ability to process sequential data, to analyze historical stock data of Vinamilk and forecast its future stock prices.

2. Objectives

Data Collection and Preparation: Gather historical stock price data of Vinamilk from reliable financial sources and preprocess the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in Vinamilk's stock price data. Visualize key metrics such as daily closing prices, trading volumes, and price fluctuations over time.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the stock price data, including technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, relative strength index) and macroeconomic factors (e.g., GDP growth, interest rates), to enhance model performance.

LSTM Model Development: Build LSTM models to learn from sequential stock price data and predict future price movements. Configure model architecture and hyperparameters such as LSTM layers, batch size, epochs, and learning rate.

Model Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Optimize models by tuning hyperparameters and validating against unseen data to ensure robust predictions.

Deployment and Reporting: Implement trained LSTM models to forecast future stock prices of Vinamilk. Compile a comprehensive technical report documenting methodology, findings, and insights gained. Provide visualizations and interpretations of predicted stock price trends.

3. Tools and Technologies

Programming Languages: Python for data manipulation and model development using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for LSTM implementation.

Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing stock price trends and model predictions.

4. Expected Outcomes

By the conclusion of this project, we aim to:

Gain insights into factors influencing Vinamilk's stock prices.
Develop accurate LSTM models for predicting future stock prices.
Provide actionable insights for stakeholders and investors interested in Vinamilk's stock based on data-driven analysis.
5. Conclusion

This project highlights the application of LSTM models in forecasting stock prices, leveraging historical data to make informed predictions. It underscores the importance of data analytics in financial decision-making and the potential of deep learning techniques in capturing market dynamics.
